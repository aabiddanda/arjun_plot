Introduction
============

This is a library and collection of functions to perform common plotting routines and manipulation of matplotlib axes. Many of the functions are organized as packages to perform common plotting routines in statistical genetics in matplotlib. The primary goal is to ensure that plotting within jupyter-notebooks is easy and maximally configurable. Much of the ADMIXTURE plotting code is derived from the excellent  `dystruct <https://github.com/tyjo/dystruct>`_ package.

Many of the utilities are geared towards very easily placing: 

* removing ancillary plot borders
* placing a y=x line on any axis for easy comparison
* easy multi-panel labeling of plots

This software is mainly a personal library that I use frequently and while reasonably well-tested I cannot make any guarantees on it being bug free. If you spot any strange bugs do let me know via an `issue <https://github.com/aabiddanda/arjun_plot/issues>`_.
