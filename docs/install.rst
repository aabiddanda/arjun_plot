============


Installation from source 
------------------------

Currently, the only supported installation method is to install the package from source::
  git clone https://github.com/aabiddanda/arjun_plot.git
  cd arjun_plot/
  pip install .



Alternatively, you can use::

  pip install git+https://github.com/user/repo.git@master

We only recommend installation of the version on the main branch currently as this are the most stable versions.
