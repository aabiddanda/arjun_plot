## arjun_plot: a customized set of plotting routines mainly for population genetics

Over the course of graduate school I have had to generate **many** plots. Typically these have been using `matplotlib` routines. The package here has specific classes that represent common plots in population genetics such as:

- PCA
- ADMIXTURE / STRUCTURE
- F-statistics
- 


In addition to these plotting routines, I have generated two `matplotlib` stylesheets that I have found useful when re-generating plots for presentations (particularly in LaTeX).
